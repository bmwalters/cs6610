* What you implemented,
I implemented around 300 lines of C to parse vertices from an .obj file,
pass those vertices to OpenGL using a VBO and VAO, create OpenGL shaders
to position and color the vertices as points, recompile shaders on keypress,
and handle mouse controls for adjusting the camera.

* What you could not implement,
I could not implement centering the object based on its bounding box in time.

* Additional functionalities beyond project requirements,
N/A

* How to use your implementation,
~make && ./main [file.obj]~ after installing necessary dependencies.

- Left click and drag to adjust the camera angles.
- Right click and drag to adjust the camera distance.
- Press F6 to recompile shaders.
- Press esc to exit the program.

* What operating system and compiler you used, and
I tested using Arch Linux with gcc 10.2.0.
I may have broken macOS support in this version.

* External libraries and additional requirements to compile your project.
- SDL2
- GLEW

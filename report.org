* What you implemented,
I implemented around 100 lines of C which creates an OpenGL window using SDL2,
responds to keypresses, and animates a background color that changes over time.

* What you could not implement,
N/A

* Additional functionalities beyond project requirements,
N/A

* How to use your implementation,
`make && ./main` after installing necessary dependencies.

* What operating system and compiler you used, and
I tested using macOS with the system clang.
I attempted to support other unixes in the Makefile but have not tested any.

* External libraries and additional requirements to compile your project.
